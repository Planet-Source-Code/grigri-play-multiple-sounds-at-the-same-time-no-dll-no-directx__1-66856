## Play multiple sounds at the same time \(no DLL, no DirectX\)

### Description

Playing multiple sounds simultaneously is not an easy task, especially in VB.

Most VB applications (and games!) that use sound use the PlaySound()

API function [which only allows one sound at a time]; others resort to DirectX

or third-party DLLs such as BASS. This project is a first step to ending all

that, presenting an API-only method.

----

I don't know if it's compatible with VB5, any feedback on this would be appreciated.

Includes an extensive ReadMe file, full demo and clean, commented code.
